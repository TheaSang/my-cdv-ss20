##This is my first exercise

In this exercise, I realize the function: a numerical input with submit button that creates boxes (div elements) and puts them on the page.
I face one problems at first. That is I don't know how to clear out the div before loop. After asking for help from Leon and researching on Google, I use   `document.getElementById("show").innerHTML = ""`I am not sure whether it is the proper format. Why are there red lines?
Also, I find GitHub support Emoji! soooo cute :grinning:
