<p >What	is	<mark id = "mark">fandom</mark>?	To	many	fans,	“Fandom	is	a	way	of	life”.	Fandom	is	a	group	of

gathering	around	“common	media”	and	a	common	love.	Fandom	is	production
and	creation.	Fandom	can	and	will	form	around	any	cultural	media	product	that	sparks	interest	in	its
audience.	The	most	popular	types	of	fandom	tend	to	form	around	TV	shows	and	movies,	as	well	as
books	and	video	games,	with	different	fandoms	then	forming	different	communities	underneath	the

<p>Here, any death can be rewrite</p>
<p>Over the thousands of pages of “Harry Potter” books, funeral bells rang almost constantly. Baby Harry’s first nickname is “The Boy Who Lived.” However, where Harry goes, death tends to follow. From Severus Snape to Lord Voldemort, from Dobby to pet Hedwig, their death might be heartrending or reassuring, might have detailed description or only a few words. All of them possibly leave profound impacts in someone’s heart. In the fan-made “Hogwarts”, the death has new stories.
