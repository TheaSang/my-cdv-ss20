####Discription:

The Monthly Hogwarts is an electronic newspaper about Harry Potter Fanfictions. Our mission is to record and report the history of HP Fanfictions and provide information for HP fandom. Through our newspaper, we hope the HP fanfiction community can better understand themselves including their writing/reading behaviours, content preference and even their identity. Also, we welcome all the outsiders read our newspaper and have general knowledge about fanfictions community. There must exist irreconcilable preference between mainsteam and subculture, but we hope the respect can come first.The overall design of website continue the style of Hogwarts. Hope it can make you feel like reading a magic newspaper.

The Monthly Hogwarts: April Report is an April analysis about Harry Potter fanfictions. It contains four parts: Overview, Relationships/Parings analysis, Cross-fandom Fanfictions analysis and April story recommendation.
