<p><mark>April Story Recommendation</mark> <br>
<mark style="font-size:25px">Keywords: Reborn</mark><br><br>

Over the thousands of pages of “Harry Potter” books, funeral bells rang almost constantly. Baby Harry’s first nickname is “The Boy Who Lived.” However, where Harry goes, death tends to follow. From Severus Snape to Lord Voldemort, from Dobby to pet Hedwig, their death might be heartrending or reassuring, might have detailed description or only a few words. All of them possibly leave profound impacts in someone’s heart. In the fan-made “Hogwarts”, the death has new stories. The stories assigned the death new life stories, or new setting, or new relationships or even new life.
<br><br><br>We elaborately chose Death & Reborn as the keyword for April Story Recommendation. Due to the COCID-19, most of the people locked at home and in the past few months, we had received tons of bad news and witnessed illness and death. Times might be a little distressing before, but things are being better. We can get through the difficult days together. We hope the article we select can interest you and inspire you. Keep creating. Keep researching and recording. Keep reading and leaving comments. And above all else, please, stay safe. </p>

      <br>—— News For Magic<br>
      <br>The Monthly Hogwarts is a fan-made newspaper based in Harry Potter fandom in Archive of Our Own. It is delivered on a monthly basis to nearly every HP fans's AO3 email boxes. Subscriptions cost $36 per year. It records and reports on the things going on the fanfiction world (albeit not always ina unbiased way).
    <br><br><mark style="font-size:25px"> History</mark><br>The Monthly Hogwarts has been produced since 2008, which was syncing with the development of Archive of Our Own. However, the history of Harry Potter fanfictions is much longer. Luckily, Archive of Our Own collected the Harry Potter Fanfitions since 1999. We spent some time on collecting and disposaling previous fanfictions and writing reports to supplement The Monthly Hogwarts. Thus, the first report was NO.1 1999 Oct. It only containes one piece of fanfiction. During the past 20 years, the number of fanfictions demostrates the explosive growth potential and the fanfictions worlds demonstrates vigorous scene. <br><br>
    <mark style="font-size:25px"> Content</Mark><br>The monthly report is mainly composed of four parts: monthly overview, relationships|paring analysis, cross-fandom analysis and story recommendation. The firt three part is based on the monthly data collected from Archive of Our Own. The keywords of story recommendation are selected from fans' contributions.
<br><br><mark style="font-size:25px"> Mission</mark> <br>Record the history of Harry Potter Fanfictions. Create the newspaper for Harry Potter fandom.
<br><br><mark style="font-size:25px"> Why Archive of Our Own</mark><br>
We choose to collobrate with Archive of Our Own because of our similar ideas towards fanfictions and fandoms. We all cherish the value and history of fanfictions and want to keep the history of fandoms. (See more detailed in FAQ)  <br>

        <mark style="font-size:1.3rem;background-color: inherit;text-decoration:underline">What is Arhive of Our Own?</mark><br>
            Archive of Our Own (AO3) is a nonprofit open source repository for fanfiction (fic) and other fanworks contributed by users. The site was created in 2008 by the Organization for Transformative Works and went into open beta in 2009. As of 2019, Archive of Our Own hosted 5.5 million works in over 35,000 fandoms. The site has received positive reception for its curation, organization and design, mostly done by readers and writers of fanfiction.
            <br>(see details <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/about" target="_blank">here</a>) <br><br>

<mark style="font-size:25px">Keywords Explanation</mark><br><br>
  <mark style="font-size:1.3rem;background-color: inherit;text-decoration:underline">What is Relationship?</mark><br>
  M/M: The Male/Male relationship;<br>
  F/M: The Female/Male relationship;<br>
  F/F: The Female/Female relationship;<br>
  Gen: The General (no romantic or sexual relationships, or relationships which are not the main focus of the work) relationships;<br>
  Multi: The Multi (more than one kind of relationship, or a relationship with multiple partners) relationships;<br>
  Other: The relationships did not fit in the existing catagories;<br>
<br>
  <mark style="font-size:1.3rem;background-color: inherit;text-decoration:underline">What is Fandom?</mark><br>
A fandom is a subculture composed of fans characterized by a feeling of empathy and camaraderie with others who share a common interest. Fans typically are interested in even minor details of the object(s) of their fandom and spend a significant portion of their time and energy involved with their interest, often as a part of a social network with particular practices (a fandom); this is what differentiates "fannish" (fandom-affiliated) fans from those with only a casual interest.
<br> It is quite normal to see cross-fandom fanfictions as fans may belong to different fandoms.
