# Week5 Reading Response —— Thea(Sang)

**Think of contemporary systems/applications in which data is used to predict the future in order to then act upon it. Compile a list of 3 such situations that come to your mind and describe them briefly.**

1.Book, newspaper, magazine circulation prediction: publishers or issuers will base on previous data like circulation over the years, the development of paper media, economic condition, social development to predict the future circulation and act upon this prediction.

2.Weather forecasting: Weather forecasts are made by collecting quantitative data about the current state of the atmosphere at a given place and using meteorology to project how the atmosphere will change. Production activities, agricultural activities and people’s daily activities are based on weather forecasting.

3.Prediction on Coronavirus: About one month ago, professionals gave predictions on the trend of Coronavirus based on the existing infected people, the flow of people and so on. Based on this prediction, the related institution quickly takes action and responded to the serious condition.



**Collect your thoughts on the Prediction and its role in the three above sources. Your associations, opinions, and ideas may be complemented by reflections on "collective average vs individual fate", "statistic vs. algorithmic prediction" or "social physics" (but don't feel obliged to discuss these). Express yourself in 300-400 words.**

The current data analysis system is quite good at drawing conclusions among big data and applying the conclusion in the future situation. It certainly benefits the overall society in different activities. However, the problems still exist and become more serious with the development of the data analysis system and prediction system. Three cases we studied this week present a lot of questions among algorithmic prediction. Will the current prediction influence the future? Should we ignore the minority report during the process of prediction? Is the general data can apply to predict each individual? How does the algorithmic prediction influence human behaviors?

I want to discuss two aspects of the current algorithmic system. Firstly, the prediction is based on the conclusion but is applied in an uncertain situation. In other words, the conclusion is the general idea abstracted from each specific case while the prediction applies the general idea to a specific case, especially when predicting the risk of insurance and the rate of crimes. These are two opposite processes. During the process of the former one, the algorithmic system tried to find the most presentative conclusion and even usually purposely ignore the minority report. But each individual case has its uniqueness, they free out the average level but finally is regarded as average. Using the general conclusion to predict specific case usually contains bias.

Apart from the logic of conclusion and prediction, the relationship between the algorithmic system and human being also influence the final prediction. For example, in the podcast of “Reply All's 'The Crime Machine', the behaviors of police influenced by the prediction system as they realized each recording, they input in the system will influence the final prediction result, which directly related to their work performance.

Relying too much on the prediction system is dangerous, especially the technology is constantly showing its great power.  The conclusion could be the reference, but its application needs great consideration. However, in most cases, it is hard to consider the uniqueness of each individual. The existence of algorithmic prediction might be generalizing the society at an average level and achieve relative fairness.
