**Description:**
This data is collected from FanFiction, one of World's largest fanfiction archive and forum where fanfic writers and readers around the globe gather to share their passion. It contains all HP Fanfic entries written between 2004-2019 in all available languages. I like this dataset because it has detailed attributes on a piece of data, such as published year, language, characters, reviews, rant and so on, which allow me to analyze different aspects. As a supporter of Fanfiction as well as a fan of Harry Potter, I would like to explore which characters and pairing are the most attractive to people in different areas, different writing styles and different reading patterns in different countries.

**Title:**
**MoMA, mo’ data**

**Description:**
This dataset containing 120,000 pieces of data about the artworks in the Museum of Modern. Each piece of MoMA data contains the names, the dates created and acquired, the size and the medium of the artwork as well as name, nationality, gender, birth year, death year of the artist. I am interested in whether the artists in the same country or live in the same era have similarity preference on the size and medium of paintings, and whether female artists and male artists will show different preference on these aspects.

**Title:**
**Word Frequency**

**Link:**
https://books.google.com/ngrams

**Description:**
It allows me to check word and phrase frequencies over time. The Viewer itself is easy to use and I can find some interesting results. But if I want to build the project based on this, I need to carefully determine my topic. Besides, I need to do a lot of research to explain the possible reason why these words or phrases have high frequencies during a specific period or in a specific country.
